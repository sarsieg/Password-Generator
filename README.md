# Password-Generator
This application is being used to generate a random and secure password for a user by using Javascript. HTML, CSS and Javascript was used to create a random password generate and shows how the use of Javascript can make changes to an HTML document. I built this project to show the power of Javascript and the uses it has when linked with CSS and HTML. It solves problems such as user input and uses variables to generate passwords. This project has mulitple features such as a generate password button that will send the user a series of different prompts and confirms then takes that user data and creates a random password using Javascript. It prompts user to choose password criteria and has them confirm if the password will contain special characters, numbers and uppercase. This application validates user input and ensures that at least one character type is selected by using If, else if statement. Once all prompts are answered the user will be presented with a matching password to the answered prompts. Event listener will determine the password output with function to make the value into the test area.
